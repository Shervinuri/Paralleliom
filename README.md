🐾 Paralleliom

Use in case of emergency 🧑🏻‍💻

Paralleliom isn’t just another script — it’s a parallel universe for your browser.

Most tools that handle multi-instance workflows hide in the background, silently doing their job.  
Paralleliom dares to step into the light. It puts **multiple browser pages side by side** inside a single frame.  
Each one is a completely separate browser identity — no shared cookies, no linked profiles, no conflicts.

Here’s the twist:  
When you interact with one page, all others react **in perfect sync**. Actions happen in parallel, yet every page stays uniquely itself.

Why it matters:  
- Run multiple accounts of the same platform at the same time  
- Test workflows in isolated browser sessions  
- Manage parallel logins without switching tabs or devices  

Born from a personal need, crafted with the help of AI, and brought to life through free hosting on **Netlify** and **Render**.  

Before you laugh at its simplicity, take a moment to think about where it could take you.
